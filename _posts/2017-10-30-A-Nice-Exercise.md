# A Nice Exercise

They say the best advice for people learning to programing is to build things. It can be anything that interests the budding programmer. I didn't always *get* this advice, because it's open ended and it can leave the student wandering around. However, I've been making attempts at applying any kind Python to a GIS applications recently and it has only left me more curious.

The first time this happened was when I was given a spreadsheet of addresses I had to find the coordinates of. I had over 200 entries and didn't want to google maps the coordinates for each, so I found a geocoder library for python and used that to get the coordinates. Libraries are probably seen as crutches by some more professional programmers, and I understand why after taking cs50, but it made me only want to keep applying python in different ways. My most recent was a short script using an imaging library to make JPGs into TIFs. Some regex was used, and it also lead me to explore the os library, which is not known to me  since most of Javascript experience is limited to the web. It has shown me cool things programming can do and learned that I was capable of doing them as well.
