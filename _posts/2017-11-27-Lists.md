# My Return to the List

A few months ago I had started working on a Pong clone as a development exercise. I came close to finishing it, but never applied the polish it needed. This weekend, I came back to interact with it and see how far I'd come in the implementation. The things I had wanted to add came rushing back, along with even more things to add to push my learning. My problem with this great fruition of inspiration in my head is actually getting the ideas to become reality. 

Writing these ideas out diminished their hold on my ability to actually finish what I had started months ago. The act of writing them and seeing them on the page actually helped my ability to focus on one item to start. I found that I was able to go through the list one by one as opposed to keeping it all bottled in my head. The most important part from writing it down was seeing it broken down that helped me actually start. 

If you're someone embarking on a project consisting of some or many parts, then the act of writing it out piece by piece would probably be beneficial. Especially if it's regarding a topic or activity you are learning. It's something I am definitely going to return to for future projects.
