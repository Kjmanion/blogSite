# But first, Finishing the Last CS50 Problem Set

The Google Maps API documentation was laid out easily enough to finish Problem Set 8 of CS50. This consisted of just adding markers to places
that were being called from the US.txt given to us on an event listener of Javascript. I think that event listener was dragend, as the plan
was to add the markers as soon as the user stops dragging the map. The other part of the challenge was inserting html into a clicked event for
each marker with a GetJSON Call for the articles from the back-end Python/Flask from Google News. It was a good challenge and I received more exposure
to the Google Maps API. The EdX class version has a Final Project that I'm still deciding on whether to do or not. I will post a more comprehensive review
on my experience of the course. I took it slow and steady with sometimes taking a month between problem sets. I wouldn't do this again, but I stuck
with it and I am glad I did. Now on to learning more things....

## The Possibilities of PostGIS

I trained on a GIS GUI. This is, from my readings on the internet, not that different from most GISers these days. However, my readings on the internet
also tell me that this is an extremely limited way of using GIS. The FOSS4g, OR Free and Open Source Software For Geospatial, convention took place this weekend and I watched afar from my vantage point on Twitter. I don't know if it was this, or my inklings to get deeper into GIS Development that made me
finally start the PostGIS class I had purchased on Udemy so long ago. PostGIS is just a library of PostGreSQL, which is something I hadn't much exposure to.
The class is brief, but I am being exposed to all the queries one could do without being hindered by the GUI Select by Attribute. My past experience at the county office told me that instead of making the selections in steps as I had done, it could be completed in a single SQL query. I am just wetting my appetite for this, but clearly there are things that are possible that I didn't know of before.

## The Fun of Python

This weekend was the beginning of a little side job for a few weeks. It comes in the form of data entry, of which I am already 6 hours in, with a bunch
of entries to go. The spreadsheet has addresses of which I googled and found a python library to use to geocode the Latitude and Longitude coordinates
for each address. I have just been tinkering with exploring the data as a csv and can already get it to concatenate to the address I want it to. If only
I could do more for the other columns of data. Maybe in the future...
