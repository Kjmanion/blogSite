# Getting Back and Building Momentum
The thought of writing this post has been in my mind everyday since last Tuesday. But, I did not keep up the promise of a post a day since then. This is (sort of) acceptable to me as I wanted to prioritize the habit of an hour of programming everyday before this. If there is one thing I've learned from these past few years, it is to not try to change everything at once. It has to be incremental. I started running back in June after a bit of high blood pressure reading at the Doctor's. I'm already up to three miles a day, 4-5 times a week. The way up to three miles started with quite a bit of walking. The other hard part is not to beating yourself over a missed goal, but forgiving. You have to acknowledge the mistake without being too hard on.

## Thoughts on Codewars
As one comment stated regarding a solution on Codewars, "I feel very stupid after seeing this." This is something I'm getting better at with dealing with and learning. My last post was saying that some of my Codewars problems were dealt with regex. A few days later and I encounter a challenge that could have easily been solved with regex and my first solution is to break it down the long way. Codewars is definitely helping see how others approach the problem. My one worry is taking the wrong things away from other solutions. The solution to this is to just keep going and breaking things.

## Back to CS50...

Harvard's/EdX's CS50 is a great introductory class to the field of Computer Science. If you are starting out with self learning Web Development like myself, you owe it to yourself to take it (or any other number of Intro to CS classes). I had finished seven of the eight problem sets and the last one has to deal with Javascript, which I am most (um?)comfortable in. The last problem set that I had done was my first experience to setting up a back-end to a front end and it was revealing to me. I now know why there are separate positions for databases, backend, and frontend developers. I have been done with the backend Python part for a while now in this problem set, where as this integration with the handlebarjs library has been challenging. It was simpler with Jinja and Python.

22 hours later...
I typed some of this last night and just now figured out my issue. It seemed to be a jsonify([placesAr]) where the brackets were not supposed to be there. I must have spent at least three hours on two brackets needing to be deleted. As mentioned above, take note and move on. On to the the Google Maps API.

## Getting more technical

My goal is to get more technical in my posts as I go along here on this blog.
