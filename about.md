## About Me

I am a GIS Technician and aspiring Web Developer in the Washington, DC area. This space serves as a place of noting stuff down my present self is learning. This will come in handy when my future self is stuck on something I've already done. I 
am sure I'll be reflecting on my past self as well. It's going to start as a blog of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
