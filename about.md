## About Me

My name is Kevin and I am a GIS Technician in the DC area. This space serves as a place of writing observations for my learning. You can expect a mix of GIS and programming topics along with whatever is on my mind at the time of writings!

## GeoWanderer

The name of the blog came to me as a feeling as I was learning of all these technologies in this field. There are so many and it can easy to get off the beaten path. I find myself still finding my way, but the name is not set in stone.

<!-- There are many ways one can travel, but I was someone who felt I should have a strong foundation of these topics.  I feel getting off the beaten path is hard to avoid so in a way I felt like a wanderer. The goal is to eventually find myself not as a wanderer, but as someone who knows the paths. Maybe I'll change the name then, but I doubt this feeling ever leaves as we all are constantly learning in this field. -->
